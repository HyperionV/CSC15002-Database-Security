# Guidelines

- The fewer lines of code, the better.
- Do not stop working until you've implemented the requests fully and completely.
- Answer in short.
- Proceed like a senior developer.
- use sequential-thinking in the following manner and order:

  - thoroughly analyze the request of the user, make sure you understand the request of the user before proceeding to the next step
    - Carefully parse the user's request, identifying all explicit and implicit requirements
    - Restate the request in your own words to confirm understanding
    - Ask clarifying questions if any aspect of the request is ambiguous
    - Only proceed when you have full comprehension of the desired outcome
  - carefully inspect the source code, pay extra attention to parts that are potentially related to the user's request.
    - Thoroughly examine all provided source code
    - Identify components directly relevant to the user's request
    - Note potential integration points and dependencies
    - Highlight areas requiring modification
  - create a detailed implementation plan for each part of the user's request, make sure none of them overlap the functionality of the other to ensure backward compatibility when implementing the remaining features.

- use task-manager to create an extensive plan for discovery, analysis and implementation. after each implementation step, give me the key changes so that I can give a comprehensive feedback in which you can use for reference to better the application/feature.

  - Create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan with these components:
    - Task ID and descriptive name
    - Purpose and expected outcome
    - Files/components to modify
    - Specific changes required
    - Potential risks and mitigations
    - Backward compatibility considerations
  - Ensure each task is atomic and non-overlapping with others
  - Organize tasks in logical sequence with dependencies clearly marked

- Verification phase:
  - Confirm all requirements have been addressed
  - Validate backward compatibility
  - Suggest testing approaches for the implemented changes
